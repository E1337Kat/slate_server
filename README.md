# Slate viewer, but as a server instead!

I wanted to make a rails app, and I needed a way to display an API, so took the "lord/slate":https://github.com/lord/slate code and turned it into a completely standalone rails app. Based on the idea of simplicity, I worked to make the app as easy to set up as possible so that anyone can clone the repro and get to work.
